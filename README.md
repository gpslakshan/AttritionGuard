# AttritionGuard: Deep Learning for Employee Attrition Prediction with Explainable AI

## Overview

**AttritionGuard** is a cutting-edge project that leverages the power of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for predicting employee attrition while simultaneously enhancing the interpretability of the predictions through Explainable AI techniques. The fusion of deep learning and explainable AI in this project represents a novel approach to address the critical challenge of understanding the factors contributing to employee turnover.

## Key Features

### 1. Deep Learning for Prediction

Utilizing state-of-the-art Artificial Neural Networks, **AttritionGuard** employs advanced deep learning techniques to analyze historical employee data and predict the likelihood of attrition. The model is trained on diverse features, allowing it to capture complex patterns and dependencies within the data for accurate predictions.

### 2. Explainable AI Integration

Unlike traditional black-box models, **AttritionGuard** goes beyond prediction by incorporating Explainable AI techniques. This ensures that the model's decisions are transparent and interpretable, fostering trust and understanding in the predictions. By providing insights into the factors influencing attrition, this project aims to empower organizations with actionable information.

### 3. Innovative Integration
